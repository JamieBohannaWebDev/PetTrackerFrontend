# PetTracker

This was my attempt at creating a pet tracking web app as fast as possible. 

I wanted to challenge myself to see how fast I could create this funky little idea.

In total, both the front end (Angular 9, Bootstrap) and the back end (Node, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, REST APIs) took a total of 2 hours, 10 minutes and 3 seconds to complete.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
